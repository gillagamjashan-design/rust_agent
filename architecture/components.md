# System Components

## 1. Question Agent

**Purpose**: Generate relevant questions about Rust programming, project structure, best practices, and implementation details.

**Responsibilities**:
- Generate questions based on current learning context
- Write questions to `questions.txt`
- Ensure question quality and relevance
- Track which topics have been covered

**Output Format**:
```
questions.txt:
Q1: How do you structure a basic Rust project with multiple modules?
Q2: What are the best practices for error handling in Rust?
Q3: How do you implement trait bounds for generic types?
```

## 2. Answer Agent

**Purpose**: Provide detailed, accurate answers to questions generated by the Question Agent.

**Responsibilities**:
- Read questions from `questions.txt`
- Generate comprehensive answers
- Write answers to `answers.txt`
- Include code examples where relevant
- Explain Rust-specific concepts clearly

**Output Format**:
```
answers.txt:
A1: A basic Rust project is structured with:
   - Cargo.toml for dependencies and metadata
   - src/main.rs for binary projects or src/lib.rs for libraries
   - src/ directory for additional modules
   [code example]

A2: Error handling in Rust uses Result<T, E> and Option<T>...
```

## 3. Learning Agent (Main Agent)

**Purpose**: Process Q&A pairs and build a knowledge base for Rust project creation.

**Responsibilities**:
- Monitor `questions.txt` and `answers.txt`
- Parse and internalize Q&A pairs
- Build internal knowledge representation
- Apply learned patterns to generate Rust projects
- Track learning progress
- Respond to user commands (start/stop learning)

**Knowledge Representation**:
- Pattern database
- Code template library
- Best practices registry
- Project structure templates

## 4. File System Interface

**Purpose**: Manage persistent storage of questions, answers, and learned knowledge.

**Files**:
- `questions.txt` - Question queue
- `answers.txt` - Answer database
- `knowledge_base.json` - Structured learned knowledge
- `learning_state.json` - Current learning progress

## Component Communication Flow

```
Question Agent --> questions.txt
                       |
                       v
Answer Agent --> answers.txt
                       |
                       v
Learning Agent --> knowledge_base.json --> Rust Project Generation
```
