# System Components

## 1. Question Agent (Spawned Claude Code Agent)

**Type**: Spawned Claude Code agent (via Task tool)

**Purpose**: Generate relevant questions about Rust programming, project structure, best practices, and implementation details.

**How It Works**: The main orchestrator spawns this agent using the Task tool. The agent runs independently and generates questions.

**Responsibilities**:
- Generate questions based on current learning context
- Write questions to `questions.txt`
- Ensure question quality and relevance
- Track which topics have been covered

**Output Format**:
```
questions.txt:
Q1: How do you structure a basic Rust project with multiple modules?
Q2: What are the best practices for error handling in Rust?
Q3: How do you implement trait bounds for generic types?
```

## 2. Answer Agent (Spawned Claude Code Agent)

**Type**: Spawned Claude Code agent (via Task tool)

**Purpose**: Provide detailed, accurate answers to questions generated by the Question Agent.

**How It Works**: The main orchestrator spawns this agent using the Task tool. The agent runs independently, reads questions, and generates answers.

**Responsibilities**:
- Read questions from `questions.txt`
- Generate comprehensive answers
- Write answers to `answers.txt`
- Include code examples where relevant
- Explain Rust-specific concepts clearly

**Output Format**:
```
answers.txt:
A1: A basic Rust project is structured with:
   - Cargo.toml for dependencies and metadata
   - src/main.rs for binary projects or src/lib.rs for libraries
   - src/ directory for additional modules
   [code example]

A2: Error handling in Rust uses Result<T, E> and Option<T>...
```

## 3. Learning Agent (YOUR Local Rust Agent)

**Type**: Local Rust implementation - THE AGENT YOU ARE BUILDING

**Purpose**: Process Q&A pairs from spawned agents and build a knowledge base WITHOUT using any APIs.

**How It Works**: Simple Rust program that monitors questions.txt and answers.txt files, reads them, and stores knowledge locally.

**Responsibilities**:
- Monitor `questions.txt` and `answers.txt`
- Parse and internalize Q&A pairs
- Build internal knowledge representation
- Apply learned patterns to generate Rust projects
- Track learning progress
- Respond to user commands (start/stop learning)

**Knowledge Representation**:
- Pattern database
- Code template library
- Best practices registry
- Project structure templates

## 4. File System Interface

**Purpose**: Manage persistent storage of questions, answers, and learned knowledge.

**Files**:
- `questions.txt` - Question queue
- `answers.txt` - Answer database
- `knowledge_base.json` - Structured learned knowledge
- `learning_state.json` - Current learning progress

## Component Communication Flow

```
Orchestrator (spawns via Task tool)
     |
     +---> Question Agent (Claude) --> questions.txt
     |                                      |
     +---> Answer Agent (Claude) --------> answers.txt
                                            |
                                            v
                              YOUR Learning Agent (Rust) --> knowledge_base.json
                                    (reads files only)
                                            |
                                            v
                                  Rust Project Generation
