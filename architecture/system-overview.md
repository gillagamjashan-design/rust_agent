# System Overview

## Self-Learning Rust Agent

A self-learning agent system that creates and codes Rust projects without requiring external API calls. The system learns through a peer-to-peer question-and-answer mechanism between specialized agents.

## Core Concept

The system uses three main components:
1. **Question Agent** - Generates questions about Rust programming and project development
2. **Answer Agent** - Provides answers to questions generated by the Question Agent
3. **Learning Agent** - The main agent that learns from the Q&A pairs and applies knowledge to create Rust projects

## Key Features

- **API-Free Learning**: All learning happens locally without external API dependencies
- **Continuous Learning**: The system can run indefinitely until manually stopped
- **Knowledge Accumulation**: Each Q&A cycle adds to the agent's knowledge base
- **Practical Application**: The learning agent applies accumulated knowledge to real Rust project development

## Learning Mechanism

1. Question Agent generates questions and writes them to `questions.txt`
2. Answer Agent reads questions and writes answers to `answers.txt`
3. Learning Agent processes Q&A pairs to build understanding
4. Process continues until user intervention stops the teaching cycle

## Use Cases

- Automated Rust project scaffolding
- Code generation based on accumulated patterns
- Self-improving development assistance
- Learning from historical Q&A interactions
