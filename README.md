# Self-Learning Rust Agent

A self-learning agent system that creates and codes Rust projects without requiring external API calls. The system learns through a peer-to-peer question-and-answer mechanism between three specialized agents.

## Overview

This project implements an innovative learning system with a hybrid architecture:

1. **Question Agent** 🤔 - Spawned Claude Code agent that generates questions (teacher)
2. **Answer Agent** 💡 - Spawned Claude Code agent that provides answers (teacher)
3. **Learning Agent** 🧠 - YOUR local Rust agent that learns by reading files (student)

The key innovation: Spawned Claude agents teach by writing to files, YOUR agent learns by reading them WITHOUT any API calls.

## How It Works

### The Learning Cycle

```
Question Agent → questions.txt → Answer Agent → answers.txt → Learning Agent → knowledge_base.json
       ↑                                                              ↓
       └──────────────────── Continuous Learning ────────────────────┘
```

1. **Question Agent** generates questions about Rust topics (ownership, traits, lifetimes, etc.) every 2 seconds
2. **Answer Agent** reads questions and writes comprehensive answers with code examples every 2 seconds
3. **Learning Agent** monitors both files, matches Q&A pairs, extracts patterns, and builds knowledge
4. The cycle continues until you stop it with Ctrl+C

### Key Features

- **API-Free Learning** - All learning happens locally without external dependencies
- **Concurrent Execution** - All three agents run in parallel using Tokio async runtime
- **Persistent Knowledge** - Accumulated knowledge is saved to JSON format
- **Real-time Updates** - Agents update files every 2 seconds
- **Pattern Extraction** - Learning agent extracts code patterns and concepts
- **Topic Coverage** - Covers 15 core Rust topics systematically

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gillagamjashan-design/rust_agent.git
cd rust_agent

# Build the project
CARGO_HOME=../.cargo cargo build --release

# Or for development
CARGO_HOME=../.cargo cargo build
```

## Usage

### Running the System

```bash
# Run the learning system
CARGO_HOME=../.cargo cargo run
```

The system will start all three agents and begin the learning cycle. You'll see output like:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Starting three concurrent agents:
  🤔 Question Agent - Generates Rust questions
  💡 Answer Agent   - Provides detailed answers
  🧠 Learning Agent - Learns from Q&A pairs

Press Ctrl+C to stop the learning process

❓ Q1: How does Rust's ownership system prevent memory leaks? [ownership]
✅ A1: Answered question about 'ownership'
📚 Learned from Q&A #1: ownership (Total knowledge: 3 items)
```

### Stopping the System

Press **Ctrl+C** to gracefully stop all agents. The knowledge will be saved automatically.

## Output Files

The system creates three files in the `data/` directory:

### 1. `questions.txt`
Contains timestamped questions generated by the Question Agent:

```
[2026-02-19 23:16:31] Q1: How does Rust's ownership system prevent memory leaks? [ownership]
[2026-02-19 23:16:33] Q2: What is the borrowing checker and what does it do? [borrowing]
```

### 2. `answers.txt`
Contains detailed answers with code examples:

```
[2026-02-19 23:16:33] A1: Ownership is Rust's most unique feature...

[CODE_EXAMPLE_1]
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;
    println!("{}", s2);
}
[/CODE_EXAMPLE]
```

### 3. `knowledge_base.json`
Structured knowledge base with Q&A pairs, patterns, and metadata:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "qa_pairs": [...],
  "patterns": {...},
  "topics_covered": ["ownership", "borrowing", ...],
  "last_updated": "2026-02-19T23:16:39Z"
}
```

## Topics Covered

The system teaches and learns about these Rust topics:

- **Ownership** - Memory management and ownership rules
- **Borrowing** - References and the borrow checker
- **Lifetimes** - Lifetime annotations and inference
- **Traits** - Trait definitions and implementations
- **Generics** - Generic types and monomorphization
- **Error Handling** - Result, Option, and error propagation
- **Modules** - Code organization and privacy
- **Cargo** - Package management and build system
- **Testing** - Unit and integration tests
- **Macros** - Declarative and procedural macros
- **Concurrency** - Threads, channels, Arc, Mutex
- **Smart Pointers** - Box, Rc, RefCell, Arc
- **Iterators** - Iterator trait and adapters
- **Closures** - Anonymous functions and capture
- **Pattern Matching** - Match expressions and destructuring
